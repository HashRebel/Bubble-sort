This is a simple bubble sorting algorithm written by me, Robert Thompson. It is the first attempt I have ever made at an algorithm like this, so I wanted to try a bubble sorter due to it's simplicity. The algorithm works by looping through an array and comparing two index positions. If the first index is larger then the second, the two are swapped and the loop moves back a position. If not, then the loop moves onto the next index. This will cause larger numbers to "bubble" towards the end of the array and smaller numbers to come up towards the front, eventually leaving the entire array properly sorted. It even works for words, sorting them lexically. I made this algorithm using vanilla Javascript and the Mocha testing library.
